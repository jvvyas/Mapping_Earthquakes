# Mapping_Earthquakes
 To populate a Geographical Map with GeoJSON Earthquake Data from a URL. 

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world by using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes.We would see here the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and we would also see the data on a third map.

## Resources

- Data Tools: JavaScript, Python, D3.Js Libraray, GeoJSON and a Web Server

- Software: Leaflet, ES6+, ECMAScript and Visual Studio Code, API 

## Challenge Output

- The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page loads
